# Case Study: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis 🚲

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my Capstone Project for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. The goal of this analysis is to understand how **annual members** and **casual riders** use Cyclistic bikes differently in Chicago. These insights will help design a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into long-term annual members.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Language:** R (version 4.x)
* **Libraries:** `tidyverse` (data manipulation), `lubridate` (date-time), `ggplot2` (visualization).

## 📋 The Business Task
The primary objective is to identify key differences in usage patterns to guide data-driven marketing strategies.
* **Stakeholders:** Director of Marketing, Marketing Analytics Team, and the Cyclistic Executive Team.

## 🧪 Data Process & Transformation
The analysis utilized **12 months of historical trip data** (stored as CSVs) provided by Motivate International Inc.
1. **Cleaning:** Standardized column names, removed duplicates, and handled missing station data.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created `ride_length` (trip duration) and `day_of_week` to analyze behavior.
3. **Filtering:** Removed invalid entries with non-positive trip durations to ensure data integrity.

## 💡 Key Insights
* **Commuters vs. Leisure:** Annual members maintain consistent usage during the workweek (commuting), while casual ridership peaks significantly on weekends.
* **Trip Duration:** Casual riders spend nearly **double the time** per trip (14.6–25.4 mins) compared to members (10.1–13.4 mins).
* **Seasonality:** Ridership for both groups peaks between **June and August**, identifying the optimal window for marketing campaigns.

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations
1. **Weekend Promotions:** Offer trial memberships targeting weekend leisure riders.
2. **Value-Based Messaging:** Highlight the cost-effectiveness of annual memberships for long-duration trips.
3. **Summer Campaigns:** Focus digital marketing efforts from May to August to capture peak demand.
